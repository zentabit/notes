A Good Life
The western society we live in today is fixed to money. Everybody wants money. It is repeated upon us from day one of our lives, that money is important, money is necessary et cetera.
The entire media industry relies upon people owning, people selling and people earning. There are magazines dedicated to reporting the monetary situations of celebreties. Money is success. Money is good. Money is necessary.

But is it? For one to live a happy, good and successful life, is money a necessity? My goal in this article is to give a little perspective to having a good life. You will hopefully have a wider and richer view of a good life after
reading my text.

Biologically speaking, we humans are just made to reproduce. That is our sole purpose, to pass our genes to the next generation of our species. The nature of our reproduction process requires both parties to be
healthy exemplars of humankind. The well-being of the male and the female creates the oppotunity to create a healthy child. This in turn creates a requirement for the "maters" to eat well, to exercise, and to have a good night's sleep, every night.
Let us consider that you are a healthy member of the human race. Apart from the biological benefits, feeling good about yourself also makes you more sociable. We humans, as social creatures, require social interaction to function
well, be it less or more of it. It has been scientifically proven that social interaction releases substances in your brain that makes you feel good. So in order to have a good life, stay social.

I am a thinker. I spend the majority of my days thinking, sometimes about equations, sometimes about my existence in this universe. When I stop thinking, I crave for something else to think about. This makes me a very productive man.
It also makes it hard for me to actually rest my brain and just shut down for a minute. For me, a good life is a life where I always have something to think about.

As I have stated in this text, a good life has some parts that are common for every human, and some parts that are very individual and must be discovered by every man himself. Being healthy is a biological necessity, while the 
feeling of having money in your pocket make some people happy. There are tribes that live entirely without money, and their happiness comes from other sources.

Our society is evolving, and who knows where we will end up? If we humans learn to transfer our minds to computers, there will not be a need to stay healthy to have a good life. The good life of a future human will maybe include
having rigorous amounts of RAM. Who knows?

For now, let us all appreciate the fact that all of us are living good lives in one way or another, and let's discover what the future has planned for us.
